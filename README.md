<h1>Hello everyone, my name is Abigail :3</h1>

I am an avid, learning and curious programmer (and artist) and I go to great lengths to learn the ins and outs of everything.
I have been programming for around 5 years, modding games for 3 years, and web designing for 1 year (and a half.)

 Here are some cool facts because I need to make this similar to my gf's README for no particular reason

- 🔧 I learn JavaScript at home, not from a homeschool or random tutor, but my own gf
- 🍝 My favourite lunch food is pasta (mainly lasagna and penne pasta)
- 💜 My favourite colour is lavender purple; pink is a runner-up
- 🌈 I am queer but don't exactly know my sexuality
- 🏳️‍⚧️ I am transfeminine :3
- 🪟My current OS is Windows 10.
   -   My computer is too expensive to risk to upgrade to Linux, and no way in hell am I "upgrading" to 11
- 🎨 Terraria is my most-played game, and my inspiration for pixel art.
- 👩‍🎨 Pixel Artist for 5 years
- 🖥️ I own an iPad that was meant for drawing, but my stylus broke so I play rhythm games on it
- 🦊 Foxgirl for 1 year
   - If you want to be specific, I am a kitsune girl
- 🩷 Taken by the love of my life
